Flexbox
    In this lesson, you'll learn about the CSS layout module, Flexbox.
    While this module has many properties, you'll focus on the most commonly used ones.
    Flexbox is really useful, so get going and add this to your skillset!

What is Flexbox?
    a CSS layout module
    Up until now, we've used float for aligning items horizontally. However, now we can use Flexbox to achieve the same thing more efficiently.

What Flexbox Can Do
    With Flexbox, you can easily create different layouts as shown below.

Creating a Horizontal Layout

What is display: flex?
    Setting display: flex on an element will horizontally stack its children.

Creating a Horizontal Layout
What is flex: auto?
    When you set flex: auto on an element, it will expand to fill as much space as it can within the parent.

How to use flex: auto
    If you have an element that you want to expand as much as it can within the parent element, set flex: auto on it.

Wrapping the Elements Into Two Rows
What is flex-wrap: wrap?
    By setting flex-wrap: wrap, a single row of elements will be able to wrap into multiple rows based on the element size.

How to use flex-wrap: wrap
    Set flex-wrap: wrap on the parent of the elements that should be wrapped. The elements themselves will need to have the width set. 
    This time, since we want to break the list into two rows, we'll set width: 50%.

Review of Percentage Size
    Let's review using a percentage for the size of an element. 
    When using a percentage % for the height or width of an element, the size of the element will become relative to the size of its parent.

Wrapping on Smaller Screens
Using Media Queries
To make a site responsive, we'll use media queries, which we have covered in HTML Study III. We can make it so that the list only wraps when the screen width is small.

Using One Column for the Smallest Screens
What is flex-direction: column?
Setting flex-direction: column makes all elements stack vertically instead of horizontally.

How to use flex-direction: column
For elements that you want to stack vertically, set flex-direction: column on their parent element.

Centering Block Elements
Let's review how to center block elements. By setting margin: 0 auto and the width of an element, you can center it. 
Since we've already set the width of the elements for screens 1000px and under, we only need to set the margin here.

Using Media Queries
By using media queries, we can make it so that the list becomes a single column on the smallest of screen sizes.
