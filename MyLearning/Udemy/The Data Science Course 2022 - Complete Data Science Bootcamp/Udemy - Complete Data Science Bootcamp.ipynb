However, implementing effective inventory management means supplying enough stock to meet demand, with the minimal amount of waste and cost. To do this well, you can perform an in depth analysis of past sales transactions for the purpose of identifying seasonality patterns and the times of the year with the highest sales. Additionally, you could track your inventory to identify the months of which you have over or under stocked. A detailed analysis can even pinpoint the day or time of day where the need for a good is highest.

    "    * This setting can be applied to a big part of the statistical problems we face today, and is an important part of this course.\n",

    "    * In the same way that the Z-statistic is related to the standard normal distribution, The T-statistic is related to the Student's T distribution.\n",
    "* ![Alt text](img/107.%20Student's%20T%20Distribution2.jpg)\n",

It is then up to the researcher to decide whether the variable is statistically significant or not. Generally, software is designed to calculate the P value to the third digit after the separator. The point is, when you start conducting your own research you would love to be able to see the three zeros after the dot. The closer to zero your P value is the more significant is the result you've obtained.\n",

    "    * No matter if we are dealing with the normal, students T, binomial or uniform distribution, whatever the test the P value rationale holds. **If the P value is lower than the level of significance you reject the null hypothesis**. Having said that, you would normally use the P value in the presence of a digital medium. \n",

So, which is the Boolean element we have in this computational logic? Basically, after you insert your if statement, the computer will attach a Boolean value to it. Depending on the value of its outcome, true or false, it will produce one of the suggested outputs, \"Correct\" or \"Incorrect\". If the first statement is true, that is, if x is greater than four, the machine will print the corresponding statement, \"Correct\", else, which means if the statement x greater than four is untrue, or more precisely, false, the statement \"Incorrect\" will be printed. From a certain perspective, everything in a computer system is Boolean, comprising sequences of zeros and ones, false and true.This is why we are paying attention to the Boolean value.

    "* Pay attention to the following. \n",
    "    * When we define a function, we specify in parentheses a parameter. In the plus 10 function, A is a parameter. Later, when we call this function, it is correct to say we provide an argument not a parameter, so we can say call plus 10 with an argument of two, call plus 10 with an argument of five. People often confuse print and return and the type of situations when we can apply them.\n",
    "* To understand the concept better, try to imagine the following.\n",
    "    * There is an argument X, which serves as an input in a function like the one we have here. The function in this case is x plus 10. Given that X is an input, we can think of it as a value we already know, so the combination of X and the function will give us the output value Y.Well, in programming return regards the value of Y, it just says to the machine after the operations executed by the function F, return me to the value of y. Return plays a connection between the second and the third step of the process. In other words a function can take an input of one or more variables and return single output composed of one or more values. This is why return can be used only once in a function. Therefore, we can say the concept of a function applies to programming almost perfectly.\n",

    "    * There are some extra advantages to consider. You could also assign a more intuitive name to a function plus 10 or addition of 10 and the function will still run correctly. This is a sign of good design, on a sheet with 1000 lines of code, if you call all your functions X one, X two, x three and so on, your colleagues will be confused and utterly unhappy. Naming functions clearly and concisely makes your programming code easy to understand and it will be accepted as one of good style."
