Additionally, you could track your inventory to identify the months of which you have over or under stocked. A detailed analysis can even pinpoint the day or time of day where the need for a good is highest.

    "        * First, males are more likely to sign the contracts and are potentially a better audience for our ads. However, we don't have any information about their marital status. Thus, this observation is a bit unclear.\n",
    "        * Second, 68% of our sales in the US come from California with Nevada, Oregon, Arizona and Colorado following behind to form 93% of the US customer base.\n",
    "        * Third, 71% of sales were made with customers age between 26 and 55 years old, with a mean of 46 years of age and a standard deviation of 13 years. Moreover, the distribution is right skewed so we expect younger people to buy more property than older people.\n",

    "* The Student's T distribution is one of the biggest breakthroughs in statistics, as it allowed inferences through small samples with an unknown population variance.\n",
    "    * This setting can be applied to a big part of the statistical problems we face today, and is an important part of this course.\n",
    "* ![Alt text](img/107.%20Student's%20T%20Distribution1.jpg)\n",
    "    * the students T distribution looks much like a normal distribution, but generally has fatter tails.\n",
    "    * Fatter tails, as you may remember, allows for a higher dispersion of variables, and there is more uncertainty.\n",
    "    * In the same way that the Z-statistic is related to the standard normal distribution, The T-statistic is related to the Student's T distribution.\n",
    "* ![Alt text](img/107.%20Student's%20T%20Distribution2.jpg)\n",
    "    * The formula that allows us to calculate it is:\n",
