Additionally, you could track your inventory to identify the months of which you have over or under stocked. A detailed analysis can even pinpoint the day or time of day where the need for a good is highest.

    "    * Second, we got standard deviations of 3.27 and 61.59 for the same pizza at the same 11 restaurants in New York City.\n",

We can confidently say that the two data sets have the same variability which is what we expected beforehand.\n",
