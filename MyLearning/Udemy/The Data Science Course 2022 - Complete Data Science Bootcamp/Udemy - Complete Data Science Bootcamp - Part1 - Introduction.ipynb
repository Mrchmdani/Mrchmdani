However, implementing effective inventory management means supplying enough stock to meet demand, with the minimal amount of waste and cost. To do this well, you can perform an in depth analysis of past sales transactions for the purpose of identifying seasonality patterns and the times of the year with the highest sales. Additionally, you could track your inventory to identify the months of which you have over or under stocked. A detailed analysis can even pinpoint the day or time of day where the need for a good is highest.
